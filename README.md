# Volcanoes
Selection of pixels for the creation of a solid polygon representing the perennial water content of the crater lake of the Tupungatito volcano, for the purpose of measuring LST and other thermal parameters. Code implemented in Google Earth Engine, with the polygon subsequently smoothed in QGIS.
The code is designed for the analysis of crater lake thermal parameters but can be adapted to other regions or volcanic lakes.
Requires Google Earth Engine access and GIS for polygon smoothing.
